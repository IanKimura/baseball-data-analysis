#About the dataset
The dataset is called mlbBat10 which is a dataset that has every baseball player that played a game in the year 2010 along with their corresponding stats. I chose this dataset because of my strong interest in the sport of baseball. I have been playing and watching baseball since I was 5 and wanted to take my interest further analyzing players. 

#Stating the problem
The problem or question I wanted to ask was about what made baseball good offensively. Baseball is such an interesting sport because of how diverse the definition of "good" is and is fascinating hearing the conversations of people comparing players. I also take a look at the differences in speed and strength while comparing it to the different position that each player plays to see any relationships.
